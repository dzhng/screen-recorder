# Local service composition

The menu-bar app owns this service process. The [canonical entry](src/main.ts)
composes the local listener, durable [core owners](../../packages/core/README.md)
and native execution. CLI, MCP and app controls call the same operations. Building
this composition does not install it or migrate a person's library.

## Acceptance and process lifetime

The app's inherited control pipe carries multiple framed requests; the private
socket accepts one request per connection. [Protocol framing](../../packages/protocol/README.md)
owns shared bounds. A complete request line is the acceptance boundary: waiting
for EOF would make a later disconnect invisible on a half-closed Unix socket.
Bytes after acceptance cannot roll back an already committed request.

Disconnect and deadline cancellation signal accepted handlers, which must drain
their asynchronous work. Transport performs no automatic mutation retries.
Correlated bounded failures remain answerable even when the handler's result is
too large for its original response channel.

EOF or broken control output closes the listener and settles owned work. Startup
reports readiness or a structured failure; the app does not hide failure behind
a second daemon or an endless restart loop.

## Update admission

Public updater commands forward to the app's native update owner, so the UI and
CLI share one check, preference and inspection contract. Inspection and explicit
opt-out remain usable during replacement admission; they cannot authorize media
work or private replacement permits. A one-shot check leaves the automatic-update
preference unchanged, and SDK replacement still waits for existing work and CLI
clients to finish.

The [admission gate](src/update-admission.ts) joins evidence from existing work
owners and transport lifetimes. Waiting for an update leaves ordinary operations
usable. A private preparation briefly fences new requests and either returns
blockers immediately or grants one service-owned replacement permit. Prepared
admission returns retryable `UPDATING` before acquiring product resources; no work
is canceled to make the service idle.

Only the inherited app control pipe accepts [update coordination](../../packages/protocol/src/update.ts).
Release is safe to repeat and never releases a successor's permit; commitment
requires the current permit. The native app supplies update status, which health
projects beside the running release version. Until an updater reports, update
status is unavailable. Installed runtime metadata supplies the assembled app's
version; standalone builds use the [app manifest](../macos/package.json), following
the [release version owner](../../scripts/README.md#versioned-github-releases).
An unavailable updater or disabled automatic updating does not imply an unhealthy
service. This gate provides no
bundle-replacement, code-signing or launch-lock guarantee by itself.

## One runtime owner

Never unlink a live listener's path. Recovery needs proof the prior owner is gone;
a refused connection is distinct from a reachable listener or a non-socket entry.
Startup holds an exclusive advisory lock for its lifetime before probing and
reclaiming a stale socket. The lock's inode remains stable so competing starters
cannot each create a different lock after observing the same dead listener.
Kernel lock release handles process death; a PID file alone cannot supply that proof.

The listener removes only the path it bound. A second unlink after close could
remove a successor's socket. Pre-existing runtime directories must already be
private and owned; startup does not repair arbitrary directories in place.

## Coordinating work without another domain model

Public asynchronous replies use the [protocol publication contract](../../packages/protocol/README.md#published-work).
The operation boundary exposes validated domain output; execution recipes and
serialized worker results stay with their internal owners.

The service turns admitted requests into work for existing owners. Pure
[composition](../../packages/composition/README.md) defines edits and compiled
plans; [native workers](../../helpers/mac/README.md) execute physical media work.
Authoring support and execution readiness are separate. Capability discovery
must report actual prepared/native requirements rather than inventing a fallback.

`service.health` remains a cheap listener-readiness check. Explicit `service.tools`
discovery verifies the selected app's bundled tool receipt and resource hashes,
then probes its executable version and configuration under bounded work. Missing
or altered tools report unavailable without blocking native operation discovery.
Inventory is evidence about those binaries, not a promise of typed editing support.

Capture admission and donor retirement share one [source coordinator](src/capture-sources.ts).
A ready acquisition owns its media independently of its recording donor. Deletion
joins borrowers and unfinished native work before donor removal; a mutable path
or alias cannot replace the frozen authority already admitted.

[Export coordination](src/exports.ts) executes a pinned durable intent. Video,
standalone audio, plain caption sidecars and portable packages use the same
publication lifetime. Caption bytes are frozen at admission and need neither a
media encoder nor speech inference; an edit during delivery cannot replace them.
Audio-only export does not require picture preparation. Output format meaning
belongs to the composition settings owner, not another service allowlist.

Replacement trusts the recorded file identity and complete bytes, never just a
pathname or a formerly owned name. Imported-original identity belongs to the
asset owner and remains protected through aliases. The [publication owner](src/publication.ts)
retains its destination lock across native workers; the [native publication boundary](../../helpers/mac/README.md#external-publication)
explains what cooperative ownership can guarantee and why unknown displaced
entries survive a conflict.

Package extraction proves containment and retained resource identity. Adoption
also validates dependency meaning and owns managed copies. Inspecting a handle
alone does not create a project; adopted projects survive handle closure and donor
removal. [Portable resources](../../packages/core/src/project-package.ts) own the
retained evidence and prepared outputs required by project history.

The [worker lifetime](src/worker.ts) is shared by native JSON requests and argv-only
CLI execution. CLI progress cannot certify completion: zero exit, bounded output
and retirement of the owned process group are required before its caller resumes.
The existing native executable watches parent death for CLI descendants as well.
The [runtime materializer](src/runtime-materialization.ts) lends that same lifetime
to explicit model preparation. Core owns acquisition and inventory admission;
offline assembly needs the public pinned interpreter and system tools, without
borrowing developer-installed packages or creating a second downloader.
A rare kernel retirement overrun retains the owned task, logs after five seconds,
and observes slowly until the group is absent; it cannot safely release capacity
or staging merely because the standard streams closed.

The bundled Node release's libuv can corrupt parent descriptor bookkeeping during
Darwin process creation with inherited files. The shared worker selects its safe
fork path by retaining the same real/effective user ID for ordinary non-root
accounts; byte authority, account groups and retirement remain unchanged. This
workaround has no root or changed-identity execution guarantee. Remove it when a
supported bundled LTS release includes [libuv's remap fix](https://github.com/libuv/libuv/pull/5284),
after rerunning the inherited-descriptor and worker-lifetime checks. It is one
process-owner correction rather than a media-domain admission cap.

Service shutdown drains jobs, readers, publication and storage observations before
closing the catalog. The [release disposition](../../specs/done/agent-editing/release-closeout.md)
records installed evidence separately from an isolated service check.

[Speaker observations](src/speaker.ts) select one complete source channel/window
through the existing native PCM owner and invoke an explicitly prepared local
runtime through the shared JSON process owner. Execution is offline. Original
sidecar operands are captured before attempt cleanup, including model refusals.
`speaker.get` reads retained source generations or their revision projection without
native or model execution; `speaker.prepare` alone requests new acoustic work.
Portable packages preserve complete original operands and observation ordering.
Read-only package projections share the source projection, coverage and merge owners;
immutable checkpoints use the existing package context jobs and disappear on closure.
The context's metadata and job budgets apply to these inspections as to adoption.

FFmpeg operands borrow the existing held source authority. Native media facts own
support, common origin and geometry; the [input boundary](src/ffmpeg-input.ts)
uses FFprobe to bind an explicit stream to held bytes. Optional declared-color
inspection supplements the same selected stream and preserves missing fields;
it supplies neither source clocks nor permission to convert. The verified native
probe-file owner also carries explicitly selected decoded-audio inspection without
changing receipt, held-source or attempt ownership. Ordinary asset probes omit it. The
[HDR interpretation checkpoint](src/hdr-conversion.ts) consumes fresh native
whole-track interpretation evidence and agreeing declarations. Its private
selected-stream producer derives an exactly representable common movie clock and
validates the held SDR derivative before consumption. Explicitly selected audio
is copied only when actual native decoded samples, format and clock remain
identical; the work budget covers the selected support union. Chapter and timecode
metadata cannot add unselected output tracks. The [managed conversion owner](src/asset-conversion.ts) exposes explicit whole-stream
`asset.convert` through existing jobs and asset staging. It retains original dependencies,
frozen implementation hashes and exact selected source/output evidence. Current verified
paths locate those hashes; saved work recovers before execution readiness checks.
Range/acquisition conversion is unsupported.
Offline self-contained
input and a dedicated read lease per invocation prevent pathname substitution,
secondary resource resolution and shared cursor surprises. Source slots are
explicitly rewound in the existing CLI owner; this never reopens the donor path.

The render-attempt owner initializes its private parent on first use, including
when portable adoption admitted assets without a prior native import. Existing
parents still undergo the same privacy, identity and lock admission; initialization
never repairs an unsafe directory. Startup cleanup can skip an absent parent.

Managed FFmpeg artifacts reuse the render-attempt lifetime. The
[artifact seam](src/ffmpeg-artifact.ts) reserves an output slot in the held private
workspace, then requires the recipe's domain validator before exposing a readonly
identified file to its consumer. Allocation identity is distinct from completed
media evidence; hashing follows retirement and validation. Native validators and consumers use the provided attempt-bound worker so native
children retain the same directory locks if the service dies. Existing admission
and publication owners remain responsible for durable delivery.

[Loudness analysis](src/loudness.ts) consumes the same validated retained PCM as
other acoustic inspection. It executes the selected bundled scanner through the
existing CLI lifetime owner and records meter identity. Empty scanner gates are
reported as unmeasurable; peak evidence remains separate from integrated loudness.
Measurement JSON is delivered through the same cache-backed lease owner as other
acoustic evidence; callers do not reopen private cache paths. A requested sample
ceiling or a scoped meter comparison is not a universal encoded
true-peak guarantee.

[Typed audio processing](src/audio-processing.ts) borrows the native domain
scheduler: native renders complete exclusive program/detector prefixes and
consumes identified held results. The service runs only the requested static
recipe against that PCM. Full-domain state makes an excerpt a crop of the same
processed signal rather than a cold processor restart. Recipe artifacts share
one render attempt; each retained external domain adds one service file descriptor
and an inherited/duplicated descriptor pair in the consuming native child. The
compiler's existing plan bounds and worker/job admission still apply; this cost
is not a global concurrency guarantee, and descriptor exhaustion refuses work
without publishing a partial signal.

Normalization retains whole-domain before/after meter evidence and admits its
requested postconditions before publication. Gain-only feasibility is explicit;
a dynamic request also refuses a missed target. Prepared reads retain those full
measurements even when a consumer requests a short excerpt. Native and bundled
implementation identities bind the prepared recipe; neither discovery nor an
empty measurement authorizes another treatment. Audio preparation settles the
complete selected processing tap without picture work. Movie rendering resolves
matching retained final audio, or executes its full audio processing and strict
postconditions, before starting expensive picture encoding. A prepared dry signal
or intermediate step never substitutes for that final mix.

Dynamic normalization rerenders the original complete prefix with fixed first-pass
statistics and unchanged requested targets. The shared correction policy bounds
candidate count, offset and measurable progress. Every candidate's measured result
is retained; an admitted candidate stays held through correction, and the delivered
selection is explicit. Final strict admission still owns publication. Scheduling budgets
account for these bounded traversals; retained final audio skips recomputation.
AAC delivery is measured separately after decoding, because a compliant PCM master
does not establish an encoded true-peak ceiling.
