//   bun run lab:recovery [-- --out <directory>] [--microphone]
//
// Each run records this app's own fixture window and then ends it the way a crash would, at a
// different moment each time: before the writer has committed anything, while it is writing, after
// several fragments, while the take is paused, and in the middle of stopping. The app is started
// again after each one, and this reports what the next launch made of what was left — the state
// the take settled in, the duration it kept, and how much of what was recorded is gone.
//
// Every advertised interval is decoded, so nothing is reported as recovered on the strength of a
// file existing. `--microphone` narrates the takes through this Mac's default input and writes a
// clip from the end of each recovered take, which is the only way to judge whether a recovered
// tail ends where it claims to; without it no audio device is opened at all.
