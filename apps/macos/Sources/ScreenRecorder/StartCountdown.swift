/**
 The count a start shows before capture begins.

 It appears on the display the take will record, counts down, and only then answers that capture
 should begin — so the take never contains the count, and abandoning the count allocates nothing:
 no recording, no directory, no service call. Escape abandons it wherever the person is working,
 which is why the count holds that one key for exactly as long as it is on screen and gives it
 straight back.
