# Menu-bar app

The native app owns recording controls and one [local service child](../service/README.md).
Ordinary launch prepares that service without starting capture or requesting
permission. Readiness and failure are visible; process identities and interpreter
paths remain diagnostics rather than product controls.

## Shared controls and explicit access

The capture popover, Settings and recording panels consume one controls state and dispatch
the same actions. A running take retains its selected inputs; changing a preference
cannot rewrite that selection. Countdown precedes the service start request, so
canceling it creates no take. Recorder-owned controls stay outside recorded media
and do not activate the app over the source being recorded. Opening the capture
panel from the menu bar activates its window, so its native glass and controls
are ready before the first content click.

Authorization is read from native capture and requested only through an explicit
action. Screen source controls remain disabled until access is granted and explain
which permission enables them; camera-only capture stays independent of screen access.
Permission denial remains actionable without choosing another device.
Camera and microphone discovery do not depend on screen authorization. Missing
screen access produces empty screen choices, while an actual discovery failure
retains the last-good catalog and reports the error. A camera choice preserves
its device identity and never silently substitutes a disconnected device.
Login registration is the system's answer, not a second locally cached preference.
The Settings window stays available while macOS presents a permission or privacy
pane, then refreshes its state and returns to the front when Yap
becomes active again.
A client-triggered service launch suppresses the ordinary launch window; a headless
check must not take focus or play audio.

## Lifetime and delayed answers

Quit closes the service control pipe, finalizes an owned take and joins shutdown.
Escalation targets that child alone under a bounded deadline. Pending calls settle
on terminal failure instead of waiting for a channel nobody serves. Control writes
are asynchronous and bounded so a non-reading peer cannot block every deadline.

Release updates use a separate lifetime contract. The [update coordinator](Sources/Yap/UpdateCoordinator.swift)
joins existing native intent with the service's atomic permit; waiting leaves
normal operations and preview renewals usable. The [Sparkle boundary](Sources/Yap/SparkleDriver.swift)
owns scheduling and preferences through the pinned SDK. Its acknowledged launch
exclusion permits clean service EOF, and observed clean exit permits replacement.
An authenticated check that finds no newer version completes normally; a fresh
check clears prior check errors and candidate facts, while a required manual
restart remains visible.
Updater shutdown never finalizes capture, closes preview or sends a signal to
manufacture idle. An unconfirmed permit release or stalled shutdown requires an
explicit quit and reopen; there is no competing successor or automatic restart loop.
Updater relaunch preserves the selected home/defaults and suppresses launch Settings.

The [library controller](Sources/Yap/LibraryController.swift) presents
source facts and caller-created projects separately. Last-good observations survive
read errors; generations fence delayed replies after deletion, page changes or
service replacement. A recording becoming ready cannot silently create a composition.

A [preview controller](Sources/Yap/PreviewController.swift) pins identity
and holds the renewable service lease; its presentation window owns platform
player events. Export choices pin revision and destination before sending, retaining
the exact request after a lost answer. Forgotten owners cannot be revived by late
chooser, status or publication replies.
The export observer also accepts caller-created caption deliveries and preserves
their existing status/actions. Caption creation requires an explicit placement
selection, so the app's destination chooser does not offer that request.

## Runtime resolution

The [build and release owner](../../scripts/README.md) distinguishes bundled and
host interpreters. The [resolver](Sources/Yap/NodeRuntime.swift) consumes
the bundle manifest and explicit overrides. An invalid override is reported rather
than silently selecting another interpreter. A movable bundle resolves its runtime
relative to itself.

The same bundle manifest names its FFmpeg distribution and pins the signed
receipt. The app passes that selected authority to its service; neither the
service nor an external agent searches Homebrew for a replacement tool.

Probes run off the main thread with bounded output and termination. One startup
deadline covers interpreter discovery and service readiness, preventing each
candidate from borrowing a fresh service-sized budget.

## Verification and native boundaries

The [package manifest](package.json) owns app compilation and controls checks.
Controller checks link SwiftPM-owned outputs within this checkout, exercising
protocol and generation fences without capture or save panels. Optional
[audio receipt inspection](tests/audio-export-controls.mjs) reuses the pure suite.
The [verification guide](../../packages/test-harness/README.md) separates these
claims from installed, physical and perceptual acceptance.

Capture, geometry and media behavior belong to the [native owner](../../helpers/mac/README.md).
Probe entry points use those same owners; they do not define a second recorder.
The checked-in icon is an input to the build. Its [packing tool](../../scripts/render-app-icon.swift)
fits the [artwork](AppIcon-artwork.png) to the macOS icon grid and shape; it runs
separately so building is not a drawing step. The capture header uses a transparent
cutout from the same artwork. The idle menu-bar mark derives its speech bubble
and eyes as a monochrome template; live recording, pause and warning indicators
remain distinguishable at menu-bar size.

## Update controls

Settings → General observes the release updater's effective availability,
automatic-update preference and status. **Check for Updates** checks immediately
and downloads an available compatible candidate; a one-shot request works with
automatic updates off without changing that preference. The button is disabled
while the SDK is busy or a restart is required. Completion, progress and failures
remain visible in Settings.

The UI and CLI use the same public updater operations and native SDK boundary.
Settings calls that boundary locally, so opt-out remains usable when the child
service fails or is closing; the CLI forwards through its service connection.
Sparkle owns scheduling, preference persistence and staged-update cancellation;
the coordinator owns installation admission for both scheduled and one-shot
checks. Neither surface bypasses recording, service or launcher exclusion.
Updater inspection and preference cancellation remain accessible during service
admission because they acquire no media resources. Settings never writes another
update preference or infers installation permission from its checkbox. Source and
personal builds without release metadata show a manual-update explanation.

The [offscreen settings renderer](tests/settings-view-shots.mjs) draws the production
view with synthetic owner facts and checks that the form still scrolls to General.
It proves presentation without a service or permission inspection. Actual updater
persistence, staged disarming and quiet relaunch belong to native coordination
and the installed-update gate.

## Capture and Library presentation

The [capture view](Sources/Yap/CaptureView.swift) consumes immutable
rendering facts and emits supplied intents. It holds no capture selection, service
state or recording clock. The controls owner admits those intents; the popover owns explicit dismissal
and leaves capture selection with the shared controls state. Enabling camera capture offers the
system's default camera when no device has been chosen; an existing choice never substitutes a
disconnected device. The capture panel requests a dark native appearance; menu-bar opening establishes
key-window focus. Status stays outside the scrolling controls.
The native popover frame owns the backdrop and arrow together; content adds no
outer panel or stroke. Library has one entry point in the capture header, and its
canonical controls action stays the same regardless of that placement.

Run `node apps/macos/tests/capture-view-shots.mjs` from the repository root for
focused native interaction, applicability and scroll checks plus offscreen images.
`SHOTS` selects the output directory. The [fixture](tests/fixtures/capture-view.swift)
owns synthetic scenarios; its images and metadata record native size, appearance
and backing scale. This renderer never enumerates devices, inspects permissions,
starts capture or activates the app.

The [Library view](Sources/Yap/LibraryView.swift) consumes shared
saved-item facts from the controls presentation owners. Those owners retain title,
failure detail and action applicability; the view keeps only its session-local tab,
filter and scroll position. The paging owner explicitly clears the page filter.
Unavailable thumbnails use a source icon, so presentation never creates media jobs.
The [offscreen Library fixture](tests/library-view-shots.mjs) renders synthetic
observations without service reads or window activation; run it from the repository
root to inspect presentation with synthetic observations. The retained Library window
opens independently, closes without quitting, and preserves its session-local browsing
state. Closing the popover does not close Library. Item actions keep their explicit
identities during asynchronous refreshes; their existing controllers admit execution.
